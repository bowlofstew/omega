About
=====

A package for automata-theoretic and symbolic algorithms that manipulate omega-regular languages.
It contains:

- parser of temporal logic
- translation from past to future LTL, using temporal testers
- classes for enumerated and semi-symbolic automata and transition systems
- class for symbolic automata that includes compiling methods that take care for initializing and maintaining the underlying BDDs via bitblasting of first-order temporal logic
- flattening of semi-symbolic transition systems to LTL
